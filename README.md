# QUnitProj
Testing JavaScript functions using QUnit


JavaScript functions were created to perform certain tasks according to spec:
e.g.
range(2, 5) --> [2,3,4,5]
compute(1,2,3,4) --> [2,3] - Returns an array of the second lower and highest
areConsecutive(numArr, allowDuplicates) - Determines whether the numbers in an array are consective

This project utilizes QUnit function: assert.equal(), assert.deepQual() and etc to check whether the functions above
works correctly.
