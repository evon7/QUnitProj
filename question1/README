Let's do some TDD (Test Driven Development).

What is needed
=============
1. Write the function which makes all the tests pass
2. Add more tests (upto you) after making the existing test pass

What is provided
================
There are three files in this directory
-- range.js (This is am empty function that you will be developing)
-- range-tests.js (The test suite which tests whether the function is working)
-- range-tests.html (The QUnit test which can be executed in the browser)


Your task is to provide implementaiton for the following function

    function range(start, end, [step])

Here is what the function should do:
====================================

Function takes two arguments (start and end) and optionally takes a third
argument called step. The function should return an array containing all the
numbers from start up to end (including both start as well as end).

The step if provided indicates the "step" value used to build up the array.

If step is not provided, it should return an array which increments (or decrements)
the elements by 1.

Examples:
=========

range(2,5) --> [2,3,4,5]
range(5,3) --> [5,4,3]
range(3,10,3) --> [3,6,9]

In all the cases where the parameters are invalid,
the function should return undefined


Test Driven Development
=======================
Start by running the tests in the browser. Initially majority of tests will
fail. Start by adding implementation and making tests succeed one after the another.
Once all the test passes, you can be assured that your function works as expecdted.


Adding more Tests
=================
After you have developed the function such that all the tests passes, please
add few more tests that you may think tests areas not tested by tests provided
by me.
